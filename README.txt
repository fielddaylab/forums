This is a sparse representation of the diffs from a base install of phpbb3.1.9 to the ARIS forums.

After copying all files to their respective locations in the base phpbb install folder, these actions need to be completed within PHPBB's ACP:

1- Under the GENERAL tab, under CLIENT COMMUNICATION on the sidebar, click Authentication. Change the Authentication dropdown to Aris.
2- Under the GENERAL tab, under BOARD CONFIGURATION on the sidebar, click User registration settings. Change the Account Activation dropdown to Disable registration.
